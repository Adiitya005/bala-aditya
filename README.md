 Prodigy Infotech Internship Task – Python Caesar Cipher 🔐
As part of my internship with @Prodigy Infotech, I developed a Python program that implements the Caesar Cipher encryption & decryption algorithm.
✨ Key Features:
 🔹 Encrypt & decrypt any text with a custom shift value
 🔹 Preserves uppercase, lowercase, and special characters
 🔹 Simple interactive terminal interface
This task not only enhanced my Python skills but also gave me a deeper understanding of basic cryptography concepts — a stepping stone towards advanced cybersecurity applications.
